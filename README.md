# potiongame
A small potion management game made for Two Desperados Game Jam 2025, theme - three rules.
In my game, the three rules meant to be followed in order to win are : 
1. Brew at least 5 potions
2. Brew at least 1 of each kind
3. Leave your cart stocked up (meaning you should have at least 1 potion remaining before the timer runs out)
Mechanics I have for the game are picking the right ingredients, brewing potions and selling them before the timer (which lasts 60 secods) runs out.
